                    <p>In this review, I want to give you my first thoughts about the Apple Vision Pro headset after
                        a week of using it for productivity and entertainment. I will also include some of my
                        thoughts about the XR industry as a whole and how the AVP changes things. Direct comparisons
                        to other headsets and a deeper technical assessment will come soon in a longer-term review,
                        possibly in multiple installments.</p>
                    <h3>The Buying Experience, Including In-Store Demo</h3>
                    <p>First and foremost, I want to say I hate whoever came up with the 5 a.m. PST pre-order window
                        for a U.S.-only launch. This also involved scanning my face with the front-facing FaceID
                        camera on my iPhone to get a custom fit for the headset. After that inconvenience, the
                        process of acquiring the headset amounted to going to the Apple Store during the time
                        reserved for me on the Friday morning of the AVP launch. The store seemed to be running a
                        little late and understaffed in the earlier hours, but reinforcements came along to give
                        demos and help people set up their headsets.</p>
                    <!-- <img src="image/tech/apple1.jpg" alt=""> -->

                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IY4x85zqoJM?si=wJoIg8peTzd_6KCe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>I really like it that Apple Store staff give new owners a demo of the headset before sending
                        them home with it. Before the demo starts, a staff member scans your face (again) to make
                        sure the measurements are correct. The Vision Pro arrives on a platter—like a fine-dining
                        experience—and the employee uses an iPad to walk you through the headset’s capabilities and
                        interfaces. They also offer to test the fit there in the store if you really want to be
                        sure. Once the demo is over, you go to another table where they pack up your headset and
                        bring it to you. In addition to the headset, I bought the $199 travel case—the one I
                        lovingly refer to as the “marshmallow” case. Some people elect to do account setup at the
                        store as well, but I waited until I got home.</p>
                    <p>The reason these in-store demos matter is that the Vision Pro is an aspirational product that
                        Apple created to be the pinnacle experience for its spatial computing platform. A $3,500
                        headset isn’t going to sell that many units, and frankly this headset is so complicated that
                        you need the demo to understand and appreciate what Apple is trying to achieve with it. To
                        put it another way, I got a lot out of the demo, and I’ve been covering XR/spatial computing
                        professionally for years. The demo ensures that customers, regardless of their history with
                        XR, can experience the high-end specs of the Vision Pro for the first time in the controlled
                        environment and with the assistance of the well-trained staff of an Apple Store.</p>
                    <h3>Apple Vision Pro Hardware</h3>
                    <p>Apple of course made many intentional design decisions for the Vision Pro. One of the first
                        ones that jumped out at me is that the headset does not have any functional USB ports for
                        data or accessories. Among other things, this means that people using NFC tags or other
                        hardware authentication tokens cannot use them to access their accounts on this device. The
                        only USB port on the AVP is for charging the battery; it does not have any data paths at all
                        and uses a proprietary connector on both ends of the cable connecting it to the battery
                        pack. Using a battery pack is a conscious decision as well, since the headset itself is
                        already quite heavy and it would be difficult to keep the system cool if the battery were
                        inside the headset.</p>
                    <p>Having a rear-mounted battery would have been the best solution for this problem because it
                        would separate the battery from the heavy front part of the headset while also acting as a
                        counterweight for it. I believe that Apple likely moved away from this design for aesthetic
                        reasons. Yet the configuration I’m describing is the aftermarket setup I currently have on
                        my Meta Quest 3; it extends the battery life of the device and makes it more comfortable to
                        wear for longer periods. The same configuration has worked well on Microsoft’s HoloLens 2
                        and HTC Vive’s XR Elite headsets. To be fair, the standard strap for the Vision Pro is
                        extremely comfortable, but not great for long-term wear. It feels like a choice of form over
                        function here, and the dual-loop strap design for longer wear definitely looks and feels
                        like an afterthought.</p>
                    <img src="image/tech/apple2.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Apple swung for the fences with the displays on this headset, going for the absolute pinnacle
                        of micro-OLED technology with Sony’s displays (3660 x 3200 according to iFixit), delivering
                        a stunning 23 megapixels of resolution to both eyes. Combined, these displays fall somewhere
                        between 4K (8 megapixels) and 8K (32 megapixels). Incredibly, this is slightly more pixels
                        than the Dell UltraSharp 32-inch 6K monitor on my desk, which has 21 million pixels. To
                        drive so many pixels in such a small space (3,386 PPI) using only an M2 SoC, Apple
                        implemented world-class eye tracking developed by SMI, a company it acquired in 2017. This
                        enables foveated rendering, meaning that the headset renders in full resolution only for the
                        small area that the user is focusing on at a given moment. This saves on GPU cycles, which
                        improves thermals and battery life, but it also helps ensure higher and more stable frame
                        rates. Behind these displays sit lenses that have a lot of bloom when bright objects show up
                        on the screen; this feels like a problem that other last-generation headsets have already
                        fixed with newer pancake lenses.</p>
                    <p>Besides all this, there is an external lenticular display called EyeSight that enables other
                        people to see a digital representation of the user’s eyes when the user is looking at the
                        real world. People have expressed mixed reactions about the usefulness of the EyeSight
                        display, especially since it probably added significant weight to the headset. I believe
                        that it has more to do with Apple’s definition of AR and how it wants to consider the Vision
                        Pro an AR device—even though it is very much a VR device with added mixed-reality
                        passthrough. The Vision Pro is also powered by an array of cameras that enable AR
                        passthrough, hand tracking and other key functions. These are all driven by the custom R1
                        processor, which Apple designed specifically to achieve 12ms latency. (That’s the bar for a
                        good experience in mixed reality, previously established by Qualcomm in 2016 for a 90 FPS
                        experience.)</p>

                        experience.)</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the Vision Pro is an extremely high-quality piece of hardware made from premium
                        materials, but it’s too heavy (at more than 600g) and clunky to be something that I would
                        recommend, compared to readily available alternatives such as the Quest 3. I will delve more
                        deeply into weight comparisons in my longer-term review. Yes, the Vision Pro is in a class
                        of its own given its Apple M2 SoC and 16GB of RAM, but Apple also made a huge mistake in
                        shipping a 256GB base model when its own $3,500 M3 MacBook Pro starts at 1TB. Considering
                        all these compromises, I can’t imagine Steve Jobs would’ve been happy with many of the
                        design choices made on the Vision Pro. Also, if you’d like a deeper dive into the hardware
                        of the Vision Pro, I highly recommend you watch iFixit’s teardown and commentary on
                        repairability.</p>

                    <h3>Apple Vision Pro Setup</h3>
                    <p>Setting up the Vision Pro was mostly very easy. My only frustration arose from needing to log
                        in with my Apple ID on the device itself when it could have been done more easily from my
                        iPhone. There also needs to be better connectivity between the iPhone and the Vision Pro in
                        other areas, certainly for notifications and maybe even for app streaming/mirroring. I also
                        believe that being able to find and download apps from your phone to your headset is
                        absolutely key.</p>
                    <p>Moving on, the eye-tracking calibration process is also easy, which is important because it
                        is repeated every time a new user puts the headset on, including in guest mode. Speaking of
                        guest mode, I think it’s ridiculous that you can pair only one Apple ID to a $3,500 device.
                        Worse, guest mode resets every time, so you can’t establish durable guest accounts or
                        profiles. Sure, the headset is supposed to be custom fit for the original user, but having
                        someone else (my wife, for instance) use it for short periods shouldn’t make a huge
                        difference. Otherwise, the initial setup was easy.</p>
                    <img src="image/tech/apple6.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>As with any new product, there were various applications and services that I had to log into.
                        I will say that it took me days to get to the point where I was logged into everything
                        because of all the different services that required logins. Apple should make this as easy
                        as they’ve made switching phones. But my biggest gripe with the setup came from the lack of
                        any USB ports with data or NFC capabilities, which kept me from logging into my Google
                        account and syncing my contacts. Now I will have to manually export my contacts from Google
                        and import them into iCloud, which is tedious. Apple does offer a $300 USB-C developer strap
                        that enables MacBook connectivity for developers, but it is unclear whether that might work
                        for token authentication—besides being a ridiculous workaround (and price) to fix my
                        problem.</p>
                    <h3>Apple Vision Pro Interfaces And UX</h3>
                    <p>First, the good news. The eye tracking combined with the pinch gesture (see the image below)
                        is intuitive and works well as an interface. Besides that, the ability to place a window or
                        app virtually anywhere and have it stay anchored there until you move it is basically magic.
                        Indeed, it’s the most rock-solid tracking system that I have encountered in an XR device to
                        date. That said, it’s still far from perfect. For example, there needs to be a way to dock
                        windows alongside each other so that they align; there’s no easy way to “snap” them together
                        like you can with apps in Windows.</p>
                    <p>The eye tracking, which is the bedrock of many interactions in the Vision Pro, has already
                        changed the way I interact with many apps. It reminds me of the early days of touch-screen
                        PCs. After a week of using the Vision Pro, I actually caught myself trying to look-and-pinch
                        to interact with my smartphone. That said, there has been at least one instance when the eye
                        tracking seemed to drift and needed to be recalibrated. When it’s accurate, the eye tracking
                        is extremely good, but when it’s not accurate, it’s frustrating. The foveated rendering also
                        works great, and for the most part I don’t notice it at all. However, if you move your eyes
                        very quickly to the edge of the screen, you’ll notice a moment’s delay before the resolution
                        increases as the foveated rendering catches up to you.</p>

                    <p>Hand tracking is equally good and works very reliably most of the time, but sometimes it is
                        hard to know whether your hand is in range; perhaps some best practices need to be put in
                        place to ensure a good experience for users. There’s also a major lack of haptic feedback,
                        whether in the headset, in controllers or via a watch or other wearable. I would like to see
                        Apple introduce force feedback and advanced haptics so that every time you pinch to select
                        something you feel a vibration. We know this is already in the works, but it really
                        should’ve been ready at launch. After all, Apple is one of the world leaders in haptics
                        (remember the Taptic Engine that killed the headphone jack?), and the fact that haptics
                        didn’t make it into the headset at launch is disappointing.</p>
